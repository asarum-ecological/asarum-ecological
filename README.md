I’m Daniel Stewart, a plant ecologist consultant and PhD student at the University of British Columbia. My PhD research entails the exploration of innovative new techniques for restoring and constructing tidal marshes in the Fraser River Estuary, working under the direction of Dr. Tara Martin of the Conservation Decisions Lab. I’m interested in topics such as wetland plant ecology, living shorelines, botany, species invasions, estuaries, and species at risk. Don't hesitate to reach out!
