<h1>Hello!</h1>

I’m Daniel Stewart, a plant ecologist who owns a small business based out of Burnaby British Columbia (Asarum Ecological Consulting). I’m interested in plant ecology, botany, species invasions, estuaries, wetlands, species at risk. Some current projects include a morphological study on Erythranthe/Mimulus, cattail management experiemnts, and carbon sequestration-oriented restoration in the Fraser Estuary. I’m looking to collaborate on wetland/estuary related work

Please feel free to reach out to me at daniel.stewart@asarum.org
