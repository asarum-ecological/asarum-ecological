<h1>Hello!</h1>

I’m Daniel Stewart, a plant ecologist who owns a small business based out of Burnaby, British Columbia (Asarum Ecological Consulting). I'm also a PhD student at the University of British Columbia working with Dr. Tara Martin of the Conservation Decisions Lab. I’m interested in topics such as wetland plant ecology, living shorelines, botany, species invasions, estuaries, and species at risk. Don't hesitate to reach out!
