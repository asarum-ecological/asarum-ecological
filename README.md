👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Stewart, a plant ecologist who owns a small business based out of Burnaby British Columbia (Asarum Ecological).
👀 I’m interested in plant ecology, botany, species invasions, estuaries, wetlands, species at risk.
🌱 Some current projects include a morphological study on Erythranthe/Mimulus, and carbon sequestration-oriented restoration in the Fraser Estuary
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on wetland/estuary related work
📫 Please reach out to me at daniel.stewart@asarum.org
